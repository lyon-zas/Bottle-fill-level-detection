# Plant Disease detection 

In this project i used a convolutional neural network which was able to predict whether a plant is suffering from a particular disease.

The model was trained based datasets from these diseases:
* Corn-Common_rust
* Potato-Early_blight
* Tomato-Bacterial_spot

The deployed web app is available at https://plant-disease-detection-stlapp.herokuapp.com/

The web app was built in Python using the following libraries:
* streamlit
* keras
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* tensorflow
